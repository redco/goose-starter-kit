# goose-starter-kit

This is a starter kit for [Goose Parser](https://github.com/redco/goose-parser)

## Usage

First of all clone repo and start your project for it. And now there are two ways to run a project:

- inside a docker container
- directly on a local system

### Docker usage

Be aware that this way requires [Docker](https://docker.com) installed.

Start the project with command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Local system usage

```bash
npm install
DEBUG=* node lib/index.js
```
